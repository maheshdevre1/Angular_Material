Que 1) Why Client-Side Frameworks Were Introduced?
1)To Manage Application Complexity
Modern web applications like banking systems, e-commerce websites, and social media platforms became very complex. Managing large codebases with plain JavaScript became difficult and unorganized.
2)To Avoid Manual DOM Manipulation
Earlier, developers had to manually update the UI using JavaScript. This made the code messy and hard to maintain. Frameworks automatically update the UI when data changes.
3)To Support Single Page Applications (SPAs)
Frameworks like Angular and React allow applications to load once and update only necessary parts without reloading the entire page, improving speed and user experience.
4)To Provide Component-Based Architecture
Applications are divided into reusable components (e.g., navbar, dashboard, transaction list). This makes development faster and code easier to maintain.
5)To Improve Developer Productivity
Frameworks provide built-in features like routing, form validation, HTTP calls, and state management, reducing development time.
6)To Enhance Performance
Features like Virtual DOM (React) and data binding (Angular) improve performance and ensure smooth UI updates.
7)To Enable Team Collaboration
Structured architecture helps multiple developers work on the same project efficiently.

Que 2 : How Angular Application Works (Clear Explanation)
1️)Browser Loads index.html
When the user opens the website, the browser first loads the index.html file.
This file contains a special tag: <app-root></app-root>
This is just an empty placeholder. Angular will load the application inside this tag.
2)main.ts Executes (Entry Point)
After loading index.html, the browser runs the JavaScript files.
main.ts is the starting point of the Angular application.
It tells Angular: “Start the application using AppModule.”
3)Angular Bootstraps AppModule
Bootstrapping means starting the application.
Angular loads the root module called AppModule.
AppModule contains: All main components, Imported modules, Services configuration
It acts like the main control center.
4)AppComponent Loads
Inside AppModule, Angular loads the AppComponent.
AppComponent is the root component of the application.
Its template replaces the <app-root> tag in index.html.
Now the UI starts appearing on the screen.
5)Router Checks the URL : Angular Router checks the current URL.
Example: /login, /dashboard, /transfer
Based on the URL, Angular loads the correct component without refreshing the page.
This is why Angular apps are called Single Page Applications (SPA).
6)Components Render the UI
Each page is built using components.
Example in a banking app: LoginComponent, DashboardComponent,TransactionComponent
Each component has: TypeScript (logic),HTML (view), CSS (style)
7️)Services Fetch Data
Components do not directly call APIs.
They use Services.
Example: AccountService → fetch balance, TransactionService → fetch transactions
Services handle business logic and API communication.
Angular provides services using Dependency Injection (DI).
8️)Data Binding Connects Logic and UI
Data from the component is connected to HTML using data binding.
Example:
If balance = ₹50,000
It automatically shows in UI.
If balance changes → UI updates automatically.
No manual DOM update needed.
9️)Change Detection Updates DOM
Angular continuously checks for data changes.
If:
User logs in
Balance updates
New transaction added
Angular updates only the required part of the screen.
This makes the application fast and efficient.
10)Application Runs as SPA
After everything loads:
Navigation happens without page reload
Only required components change
User experience is smooth like a mobile app
