Que 1) Why Client-Side Frameworks Were Introduced?


Que 1) Why Client-Side Frameworks Were Introduced?
1)To Manage Application Complexity
Modern web applications like banking systems, e-commerce websites, and social media platforms became very complex. Managing large codebases with plain JavaScript became difficult and unorganized.
2)To Avoid Manual DOM Manipulation
Earlier, developers had to manually update the UI using JavaScript. This made the code messy and hard to maintain. Frameworks automatically update the UI when data changes.
3)To Support Single Page Applications (SPAs)
Frameworks like Angular and React allow applications to load once and update only necessary parts without reloading the entire page, improving speed and user experience.
4)To Provide Component-Based Architecture
Applications are divided into reusable components (e.g., navbar, dashboard, transaction list). This makes development faster and code easier to maintain.
5)To Improve Developer Productivity
Frameworks provide built-in features like routing, form validation, HTTP calls, and state management, reducing development time.
6)To Enhance Performance
Features like Virtual DOM (React) and data binding (Angular) improve performance and ensure smooth UI updates.
7)To Enable Team Collaboration
Structured architecture helps multiple developers work on the same project efficiently.
