Que 1) Why Client-Side Frameworks Were Introduced?
-------------------------------------------------------
1)To Manage Application Complexity
Modern web applications like banking systems, e-commerce websites, and social media platforms became very complex. Managing large codebases with 
plain JavaScript became difficult and unorganized.
2)To Avoid Manual DOM Manipulation
Earlier, developers had to manually update the UI using JavaScript. This made the code messy and hard to maintain. Frameworks automatically update the UI when data changes.
3)To Support Single Page Applications (SPAs)
Frameworks like Angular and React allow applications to load once and update only necessary parts without reloading the entire page, improving speed and user experience.
4)To Provide Component-Based Architecture
Applications are divided into reusable components (e.g., navbar, dashboard, transaction list). This makes development faster and code easier to maintain.
5)To Improve Developer Productivity
Frameworks provide built-in features like routing, form validation, HTTP calls, and state management, reducing development time.
6)To Enhance Performance
Features like Virtual DOM (React) and data binding (Angular) improve performance and ensure smooth UI updates.
7)To Enable Team Collaboration
Structured architecture helps multiple developers work on the same project efficiently.

Que 2) How Angular Application Works (Clear Explanation)
----------------------------------------------------------
1️)Browser Loads index.html
When the user opens the website, the browser first loads the index.html file.
This file contains a special tag: <app-root></app-root>
This is just an empty placeholder. Angular will load the application inside this tag.
2)main.ts Executes (Entry Point)
After loading index.html, the browser runs the JavaScript files.
main.ts is the starting point of the Angular application.
It tells Angular: “Start the application using AppModule.”
3)Angular Bootstraps AppModule
Bootstrapping means starting the application.
Angular loads the root module called AppModule.
AppModule contains: All main components, Imported modules, Services configuration
It acts like the main control center.
4)AppComponent Loads
Inside AppModule, Angular loads the AppComponent.
AppComponent is the root component of the application.
Its template replaces the <app-root> tag in index.html.
Now the UI starts appearing on the screen.
5)Router Checks the URL : Angular Router checks the current URL.
Example: /login, /dashboard, /transfer
Based on the URL, Angular loads the correct component without refreshing the page.
This is why Angular apps are called Single Page Applications (SPA).
6)Components Render the UI
Each page is built using components.
Example in a banking app: LoginComponent, DashboardComponent,TransactionComponent
Each component has: TypeScript (logic),HTML (view), CSS (style)
7️)Services Fetch Data
Components do not directly call APIs.
They use Services.
Example: AccountService → fetch balance, TransactionService → fetch transactions
Services handle business logic and API communication.
Angular provides services using Dependency Injection (DI).
8️)Data Binding Connects Logic and UI
Data from the component is connected to HTML using data binding.
Example:
If balance = ₹50,000
It automatically shows in UI.
If balance changes → UI updates automatically.
No manual DOM update needed.
9️)Change Detection Updates DOM
Angular continuously checks for data changes.
If:
User logs in
Balance updates
New transaction added
Angular updates only the required part of the screen.
This makes the application fast and efficient.
10)Application Runs as SPA
After everything loads:
Navigation happens without page reload
Only required components change
User experience is smooth like a mobile app

Que 3) How Angular Expressions Are Different from JavaScript Expressions ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)Where They Are Used
🟢 Angular Expressions
Used inside HTML templates
Written inside {{ }} (double curly braces)
<p>{{ balance }}</p>
👉 Used only in Angular template files (.html).
🔵 JavaScript Expressions
Used inside .js or .ts files
Written inside functions or script tags
let total = price * quantity;
👉 Used in normal JavaScript code.
2)Who Evaluates Them?
JavaScript expressions are executed directly by the browser’s JavaScript engine.
Angular expressions are evaluated by Angular framework inside the component.
That means Angular controls and manages its expressions.
3) Scope Difference
🟢 Angular Expression
Can access only:
Component properties
Component methods
{{ userName }}
If userName exists in component → it works.
It cannot access global variables.
🔵 JavaScript Expression
Can access:
Global variables
Function variables
Any declared variable
4)Logic Allowed
🟢 Angular Expressions (Limited)
❌ No loops
❌ No variable declaration
❌ No assignments
This will NOT work:
{{ let x = 5 }}
Angular expressions are simple and safe.
🔵 JavaScript Expressions (Full Power)
✅ Loops
✅ Variable declarations
✅ Assignments
✅ Complex logic
for(let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {}
5)Security
Angular expressions are:
✅ Automatically protected from XSS attacks
✅ Safer by default
JavaScript:
❌ Needs manual security handling
6)Main Purpose
Angular Expressions → Used for data binding (display data in UI).
JavaScript Expressions → Used for full programming logic.
🏦 Simple Banking Example
In component:
balance = 50000;
In HTML:
<p>Balance: {{ balance }}</p>
This is Angular expression.
But inside component:
let total = amount - 1000;
This is JavaScript expression.

Que 4)What are Single Page Applications (SPA)?
----------------------------------------------
1)Loads Only Once
A Single Page Application loads a single HTML page when the user first opens the website.
2)No Full Page Reload
When the user clicks links or navigates, the page does not reload completely. Only the required content changes dynamically.
3)Uses JavaScript for Updates
JavaScript frameworks like Angular or React update the UI without refreshing the browser.
4)Faster User Experience
Since the whole page is not reloaded again and again, SPAs feel faster and smoother.
5)Seamless Navigation
Navigation between pages (like dashboard, profile, settings) happens instantly.
6)Better Performance
Only necessary data is fetched from the server, reducing load time and improving efficiency.

Que 5)What Are Templates in Angular?
-------------------------------------
A template in Angular is the HTML part of a component.
It tells Angular:
👉 What to show on the screen, 👉 How to display the data
You can think of a template as the view (UI) of a component.
🏦 Simple Example
Suppose we have a Banking component.
Component (Logic - TypeScript)
export class AccountComponent {
  balance = 50000;
}
Template (HTML - View)
<h2>My Account</h2>
<p>Balance: {{ balance }}</p>
👉 {{ balance }} is an Angular expression.
👉 Angular takes the value from the component and shows it in the browser.
So:
Component → Contains logic
Template → Displays data
✅ Two Ways to Create Template in Angular
1️⃣ Inline Template
The HTML is written directly inside the component file.
Example:
@Component({
  selector: 'app-account',
  template: `
    <h2>My Account</h2>
    <p>Balance: {{ balance }}</p>
  `
})
export class AccountComponent {
  balance = 50000;
}
📌 Here, HTML is written inside the template property using backticks ( ).
✔ Used for small templates
❌ Not good for large UI
2️⃣ Linked Template (External Template)
The HTML is written in a separate .html file.
Example:
account.component.ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-account',
  templateUrl: './account.component.html'
})
export class AccountComponent {
  balance = 50000;
}
account.component.html
<h2>My Account</h2>
<p>Balance: {{ balance }}</p>
✔ Cleaner and more professional
✔ Better for large applications
✔ Mostly used in real projects
🔥 Simple Difference
Inline Template	Linked Template
HTML inside component file	HTML in separate file
Used for small UI	Used for large UI
Uses template property	Uses templateUrl property

Que 6) : What is AOT (Ahead-of-Time) Compiler in Angular?
----------------------------------------------------------
1️⃣ Compiles Code Before Running the App
AOT compiler converts Angular TypeScript and HTML templates into pure JavaScript during build time, before the app is loaded in the browser.
2️⃣ Runs During Build Process
When you run:
ng build --prod
Angular uses AOT to compile the application.
3️⃣ Faster Application Loading
Since the code is already compiled before reaching the browser, the browser does less work.
👉 This makes the application load faster.
4️⃣ Reduces Runtime Errors
AOT checks templates and code during build time.
If there is any mistake, it shows an error before deployment.
Example:
If you write wrong property name in template:
{{ balnce }}
It will give error during build.
5️⃣ Smaller Bundle Size
AOT removes unnecessary Angular compiler code from the final build.
👉 This reduces file size.
6️⃣ Better Security
Templates are compiled earlier, so there is less risk of injection attacks.

Ques 7) What is Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation?
------------------------------------------------
1️)Compilation at Runtime
JIT compiles the Angular application in the browser when the app loads.
2️)Happens During Execution
The Angular compiler runs just before the application starts, converting templates and TypeScript into JavaScript.
3️)Used in Development Mode
When we run ng serve, Angular uses JIT compilation by default.
4️)Faster Development Builds
It does not require a full build process, so changes reflect quickly during development.
5️)Slower Initial Loading
Since compilation happens in the browser, the app takes more time to load compared to AOT.
6️)Errors Appear at Runtime
Template or code errors are detected while the application is running in the browser.
👉 JIT is mainly used for development because it provides quick builds but is not recommended for production.

Ques 8) What is a Component?
-------------------------------
1) A component is the basic building block of an Angular application.
2) It controls a specific part of the user interface (UI).
3) It contains:TypeScript file → Logic, HTML file → View (UI), CSS file → Styles
4) Components make the application modular and reusable.
Example: In a banking app:
HeaderComponent
LoginComponent
DashboardComponent
TransactionComponent
5)Each part of the screen is built using components.


Que 9) What is @Component Decorator?
-------------------------------------
1)@Component is a decorator that tells Angular:
👉 “This class is a component.”
2) It provides metadata (configuration details) about the component.
3)Important Properties of @Component
✅ selector
Defines the custom HTML tag used for the component.
Example:
selector: 'app-header'
Used in HTML as:
<app-header></app-header>
✅ templateUrl
Links the component to its HTML file (UI).
templateUrl: './header.component.html'
✅ styleUrls
Links CSS file for styling the component.
styleUrls: ['./header.component.css']
✅ providers (Optional)
Used to provide services for dependency injection.
🔹 4️⃣ Example Explanation
@Component({
  selector: 'app-header',
  templateUrl: './header.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./header.component.css']
})
export class HeaderComponent {
  @Input() title: string;
  @Input() links: { name: string, url: string }[];
}
HeaderComponent controls the header section.
@Input() allows parent component to send data.
The decorator connects logic + HTML + CSS together.
🔥 Simple Summary
👉 Component = Controls a part of UI (logic + view + style).
👉 @Component decorator = Tells Angular how to create and use that component.

Ques 10) What is @Input() in Angular?
----------------------------------------
1️)@Input() is used to receive data from parent component to child component.
2️)It allows the parent component to pass values to the child component.
3️)Data flow direction:
👉 Parent → Child
🏦 Simple Example (Banking App)
Parent Component (dashboard.component.html)
<app-header [title]="'My Bank'" ></app-header>
Here, parent is sending the value "My Bank" to child.
Child Component (header.component.ts)
@Input() title: string;
Now the child can use:
<h2>{{ title }}</h2>
Output in browser:
My Bank

Que 11) What is @Output() in Angular?
--------------------------------------
1️⃣ @Output() is used to send data from child component to parent component.
2️⃣ It uses an EventEmitter to send events.
3️⃣ Data flow direction:
👉 Child → Parent
🏦 Example
Child Component (transfer.component.ts)
@Output() transferDone = new EventEmitter<string>();
sendData() {
  this.transferDone.emit("Transfer Successful");
}
Parent Component (dashboard.component.html)
<app-transfer (transferDone)="showMessage($event)"></app-transfer>
Parent TypeScript
showMessage(message: string) {
  console.log(message);
}
Now when child emits event, parent receives it.
🔥 Simple Difference
@Input()	@Output()
Parent → Child	Child → Parent
Receives data	Sends data
Used for property binding	Used for event binding
🎯 Easy Memory Trick
👉 Input = Data comes IN
👉 Output = Data goes OUT

Que 12) What is a Module in Angular? 
-------------------------------------
1️⃣ A module in Angular is a logical container that groups related components, directives, pipes, and services.
2️⃣ It helps organize the application into cohesive blocks of functionality.
3️⃣ Every Angular application has at least one root module called AppModule.
4️⃣ Modules improve code maintainability and scalability in large applications.
5️⃣ The @NgModule decorator is used to define a module.
6️⃣ Important properties of @NgModule include:
declarations – Components, directives, and pipes that belong to the module.
imports – Other modules required by this module.
providers – Services available for dependency injection.
bootstrap – The root component that starts the application.
7️⃣ Modules support feature-based development (e.g., AuthModule, AccountModule).
8️⃣ They enable lazy loading, improving application performance.

Que 13) What is Angular CLI?
1️⃣ Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a tool used to create, manage, and build Angular applications using simple commands.
2️⃣ It helps developers automate common tasks like creating components, services, and modules.
3️⃣ It reduces manual configuration and saves development time.
4️⃣ It creates a proper project structure automatically when starting a new application.
5️⃣ It supports development server, testing, building, and deployment.

ng new my-app          // Creates a new Angular project with complete folder structure and configuration.
ng serve               // Starts a development server and runs the application locally.
ng generate component header  
// Generates a new component named 'header' with required files (.ts, .html, .css, .spec.ts).
ng generate service user  
// Generates a new service file for handling business logic or API calls.
ng build               // Builds the application and generates output files in the dist folder.
ng build --prod        // Builds the application for production with optimization, AOT compilation, and minification.
ng test                // Runs unit tests using Karma.
ng lint                // Checks code quality and coding standards.
ng version             // Displays Angular CLI and Angular framework version details.

Que 14) What is a directive in Angular?
----------------------------------------
A directive in Angular is a class that adds behavior or modifies the appearance of DOM elements.
It allows developers to extend HTML functionality.
Angular provides three types of directives:
1)Component Directive – Has its own template.
2)Structural Directive – Changes DOM structure (e.g., *ngIf, *ngFor).
3)Attribute Directive – Changes appearance or behavior (e.g., ngClass, ngStyle).
✅ Short Example
Example 1 – Structural Directive (*ngIf)
<p *ngIf="isLoggedIn">Welcome User</p>
👉 Shows the paragraph only if isLoggedIn is true.
Example 2 – Attribute Directive (ngStyle)
<p [ngStyle]="{'color':'blue'}">Hello</p>
👉 Changes text color to blue.
🎯 Very Short Version (If interviewer wants quick answer)
A directive in Angular is used to modify the structure or behavior of DOM elements. Examples include *ngIf for conditional rendering and ngStyle for styling elements
dynamically.

Que 15) What is a Service in Angular?
--------------------------------------
1️⃣ A service is a class in Angular.
2️⃣ It is used to write reusable logic.
3️⃣ It helps to share data or functionality between multiple components.
4️⃣ It is commonly used for:
>Fetching data from API
>Business logic
>Storing common methods
5️⃣ Services are injected into components using Dependency Injection.

Que 16) Explain Two-Way Data Binding in Angular ?
---------------------------------------------------
1️⃣ Two-way data binding means data flows in both directions.
2️⃣ If data changes in the component (TypeScript file) → it updates in the HTML view.
3️⃣ If data changes in the HTML input field → it updates in the component automatically.
4️⃣ Angular uses [(ngModel)] for two-way data binding.
5️⃣ It combines:
Property Binding [ ]
Event Binding ( )
👉 That’s why it is written as banana in a box syntax → [(ngModel)]
Two-way data binding in Angular keeps the component data and the view synchronized using [(ngModel)], so changes in one 
automatically reflect in the other.

Que 17) Explain One-Way Data Binding in Angular ?
--------------------------------------------------
One-way data binding in Angular means data flows in a single direction only — either from the component to the view or from the view to the component. It does not automatically synchronize both sides.
Angular supports one-way binding in three ways:
✅ 1️⃣ Interpolation – {{ data }}
(Component ➝ View)👉 Used to display data from component in HTML.
Component   name = "Mahesh";
HTML <p>{{ name }}</p>
What Happens? Angular takes name from component and shows it in HTML.
✔ Output: Mahesh
✔ Data flows: Component ➝ View
✅ 2️⃣ Property Binding – [property]="data"
(Component ➝ View)
👉 Used to set HTML property value from component.
Component isDisabled = true;
HTML <button [disabled]="isDisabled">Click Me</button>
What Happens?
If isDisabled = true → button is disabled.
If isDisabled = false → button is enabled.
✔ Data flows: Component ➝ View
✅ 3️⃣ Event Binding – (event)="method()"
(View ➝ Component)
👉 Used to send event from HTML to component.
HTML <button (click)="showMessage()">Click</button>
Component
showMessage() {
  alert("Button Clicked");
}
What Happens?
When button is clicked → method runs in component.
✔ Data flows: View ➝ Component

Que 18) What is data binding in Angular JS ?
--------------------------------------------
Data Binding in AngularJS is a feature that connects the model and the view, so changes in one automatically update the other in 
real-time.
1️⃣ Model = Data in JavaScript
2️⃣ View = HTML page
3️⃣ Data Binding connects both
4️⃣ If user changes input → data updates
5️⃣ If data changes → view updates
So it works almost in real-time.
✅ Simple Example (AngularJS)
HTML
<div ng-app="">
  <input type="text" ng-model="name">
  <p>Hello {{name}}</p>
</div>
🔍 What Happens?
User types: Mahesh
Paragraph automatically shows:
👉 Hello Mahesh
If user types Rahul, it instantly updates to:
👉 Hello Rahul
No page refresh needed.

Que 19) What are Angular Lifecycle Hooks?
------------------------------------------
Angular lifecycle hooks are special methods that allow us to run code at different stages of a component’s life, such as 
initialization (ngOnInit), data change (ngOnChanges), and destruction (ngOnDestroy).
a component also has stages:
Create → Update → Destroy
Angular gives us hooks (methods) to run code at these stages.
🔹 Important Lifecycle Hooks (Simple)
1️⃣ ngOnInit()
✔ Runs once
✔ Called when component is created
✔ Used to load data (API call, initialization)
ngOnInit() {
  console.log("Component Initialized");
} 👉 Runs when component loads.
2️⃣ ngOnChanges()
✔ Runs when input property changes
✔ Used when parent sends data to child component
ngOnChanges() {
  console.log("Input value changed");
} 👉 Runs whenever input data changes.
3️⃣ ngOnDestroy()
✔ Runs before component is removed
✔ Used to clean memory (unsubscribe, clear timer)
ngOnDestroy() {
  console.log("Component Destroyed");
}
👉 Runs when component is removed from screen.

Que 20) What is Angular?
---------------------------
Angular is a modern front-end framework developed by Google to build single-page applications (SPA).
It is the new and improved version (released in 2016).
🔹 Main Features of Angular
1) Component-Based Architecture
Application is divided into small reusable parts called components.
Each component has: HTML (template),CSS (style),TypeScript (logic)
2)Uses TypeScript : TypeScript is an advanced version of JavaScript.
It supports types, classes, interfaces. Helps reduce errors.
3) High Performance
Uses AOT (Ahead Of Time) compilation.
Code is compiled before running → faster performance.
4) Mobile Friendly
Designed with mobile-first approach.
Works well for modern web apps.
5) Uses RxJS & Observables
Used for handling API calls and asynchronous data.

Que 21) What is Angular JS ?
------------------------------
AngularJS is the older version of Angular, released in 2010.
It was also developed by Google but is now outdated.
🔹 Main Features of AngularJS
1) MVC Architecture Model → Data, View → HTML, Controller → Logic
2)Uses JavaScript
No TypeScript support.
Pure JavaScript framework.
3) Two-Way Data Binding
Uses $scope and watchers.
Automatically updates UI when data changes.
4) Slower Performance
Uses runtime (dynamic) compilation.
More watchers → slower for large apps.
5) Limited Mobile Support

Que 22) What is String Interpolation in AngularJS?
-----------------------------------------------------
String interpolation in AngularJS is a way to display dynamic data in HTML using double curly braces {{ }}.
👉 Showing a JavaScript variable value inside HTML
👉 Using double curly braces {{ }}
🔹 Simple Meaning
If you have some data in JavaScript (model)
and you want to display it in HTML (view),
you use:
{{ variableName }}

<div>{{ message }}</div>
$scope.message = "Hello Mahesh";
🔹 What happens?
AngularJS takes value from $scope.message
Puts it inside {{ }}
Displays it in HTML
🔹 Output on Screen:
Hello Mahesh
🔁 Why is it useful?
If the value of message changes:
$scope.message = "Welcome!";
The HTML automatically updates to:
Welcome!
You do not need to refresh the page.

Que 23) Interpolation in Angular (2+) ?
Interpolation in Angular (2+) is a way to display component data inside HTML using double curly braces {{ }}.

Que 24) What is a Directive in AngularJS?
------------------------------------------
A directive in AngularJS is a special instruction that extends HTML by adding new behavior to elements.
It helps in data binding, DOM manipulation, event handling, and creating dynamic content.
Directives usually start with ng- (like ng-model, ng-repeat, ng-if).
✅ Types of Directives in AngularJS (With Examples)
There are 4 types of directives:
1️⃣ Element Directive
Used as a new HTML element.
<my-directive></my-directive>
Here, my-directive is used like an HTML tag.
2️⃣ Attribute Directive
Used as an attribute inside an HTML tag.
👉 This is the most commonly used type.
<input type="text" ng-model="name">
Here, ng-model binds input value to a variable.
3️⃣ CSS Class Directive
Used as a CSS class name.
<div class="my-directive"></div>
AngularJS activates the directive when the class name matches.
4️⃣ Comment Directive
Used inside an HTML comment.
<!-- directive: my-directive -->
AngularJS reads the directive from the comment.

Que 25) What is Factory in AngularJS?
-------------------------------------
A Factory in AngularJS is used to create and return an object or function.
It is mainly used to write reusable business logic.
✅ Why We Use Factory?
To share data between controllers
To write reusable code
To separate business logic from controller
✅ Simple Definition (Interview)
A factory in AngularJS is a function that returns an object or function, which can be reused and injected into controllers, 
services, or directives.
✅ Important Points (Very Simple)
1️⃣ Factory is a function.
2️⃣ It returns an object or function.
3️⃣ It helps to create reusable code.
4️⃣ It can be injected into:
Controller
Service
Directive
Filter
5️⃣ Factory returns a single shared instance (same object is used everywhere).

Que 26) What is Digest Cycle in AngularJS?
------------------------------------------------
The digest cycle is the process AngularJS uses to:
👉 Check if data (model) has changed
👉 Update the view (HTML) if needed
It keeps model and view synchronized.
When something changes in your app (like button click or input change),
AngularJS checks all variables and updates the screen automatically.
That checking process is called Digest Cycle.
✅ Important Points (Simple)
1️⃣ It checks $scope variables for changes.
2️⃣ If value changes → HTML updates automatically.
3️⃣ It runs after:
Button click (ng-click)
Input change (ng-model)
HTTP request
Timeout
4️⃣ It uses watchers to detect changes.
5️⃣ It can be manually triggered using $apply().

Que 27) What is Dependency Injection in Angular?
-------------------------------------------------
Dependency Injection means:
👉 Instead of creating an object inside a class,
👉 Angular automatically provides (injects) it from outside.
If a component needs a service,
Angular gives that service automatically.
You do not need to create it using new.
✅ Why We Use Dependency Injection?
1️⃣ To reuse code
2️⃣ To reduce tight coupling
3️⃣ To make testing easy
4️⃣ To manage services easily
✅ Important Points (Simple)
1️⃣ Angular has a built-in DI system.
2️⃣ Services are injected through the constructor.
3️⃣ We use @Injectable() for services.
4️⃣ Angular creates and manages the object for us.

Que 28)  How do you create services in Angular ?
-------------------------------------------------
A service in Angular can be created using Angular CLI with ng generate service service-name or manually by creating a
 class with the @Injectable() decorator. Services are used to share business logic or fetch data using HttpClient.
Here is the short syntax to create a service in Angular 👇
✅ Using CLI
ng g s data
✅ Service File (data.service.ts)
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class DataService {
  getData() {
    return "Hello";
  }
}
✅ Using Service in Component
constructor(private dataService: DataService) {}
ngOnInit() {
  console.log(this.dataService.getData());

}

Que 29) What is Angular Router?
-------------------------------
Angular Router is used to move between different pages (components) in a single-page application (SPA) without reloading the page.
Angular Router is a module that enables navigation between different components in a single-page application. It updates the URL and 
loads components dynamically without reloading the page.
✅ Simple Meaning
👉 It helps switch from one page to another.
👉 It changes the URL.
👉 It loads the correct component.
👉 No full page refresh happens.
✅ Important Points (Simple)
1️⃣ Used in Single Page Applications (SPA).
2️⃣ Helps navigate between components.
3️⃣ URL changes but page does not reload.
4️⃣ Routes are defined in app-routing.module.ts.
5️⃣ Uses <router-outlet> to display components.

Que 30) What is routerLink?
----------------------------
routerLink is used to navigate from one page to another in Angular.
It works like a link but without page reload.
<a routerLink="/home">Home</a>
<a routerLink="/about">About</a>
👉 When you click → Angular loads the component
👉 URL changes
👉 No refresh happens

Que 31) What is ActivatedRoute?
-------------------------------
ActivatedRoute is used to get data from the URL.
Example: If URL has ID → /user/5
We can read 5 using ActivatedRoute.
✅ Example Route:
{ path: 'user/:id', component: UserComponent }
✅ In Component:
import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';
constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute) {}
ngOnInit() {
  const id = this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get('id');
  console.log(id);
}
👉 If URL is /user/10
👉 Output will be 10
🎯 Interview Line:
ActivatedRoute is used to access route parameters, query parameters, and URL data in Angular.

Que 32) What is Route Guard?
------------------------------
Route Guard is used to control access to routes.
Only logged-in users can open dashboard.
If not logged in → redirect to login page.
import { CanActivate } from '@angular/router';
export class AuthGuard implements CanActivate {
  canActivate(): boolean {
    return false; // block route
  }
}
Add in Routing:
{ 
  path: 'dashboard', 
  component: DashboardComponent,
  canActivate: [AuthGuard]
}
👉 If true → page opens
👉 If false → page blocked
Route Guard is used to protect routes and restrict access based on conditions like authentication.

Que 33) What is scope in Angular?
----------------------------------
In Angular, scope refers to the environment or context in which variables, expressions, and functions are evaluated. It
determines the visibility and accessibility of these variables within different parts of the application, particularly 
in relation to the component's template and controller.
Note: In Angular 2+ (modern Angular), the term scope is no longer used. It is replaced by component state and data binding.

Que 34) What type of DOM is used in Angular ?
------------------------------------------------
1️⃣ Real DOM
Angular works with the Real DOM (the actual HTML structure in the browser).
When data changes, Angular updates the DOM.
But it does not refresh the full page like traditional websites.
2️⃣ Change Detection
Angular uses a Change Detection mechanism.
It checks what data has changed.
Then it updates only that specific part of the page.
This makes the application fast and efficient.
👉 Example:
If you change only the username, Angular updates only the username part, not the entire page.
3️⃣ Shadow DOM (Optional Feature)
Angular can use Shadow DOM for component style isolation.
It keeps styles and behavior of one component separate from others.
This prevents CSS conflicts between components.
👉 Example:
If two components use the same CSS class name, they will not affect each other when Shadow DOM is used.

Que 35) In how many ways can Bootstrap be embedded in Angular?
-------------------------------------------------------------
Bootstrap can be embedded in Angular in two main ways:
1️⃣ Using NPM (Recommended Method)
Install Bootstrap using npm:
npm install bootstrap
Then add Bootstrap CSS (and JS if needed) in the angular.json file under:
"styles" array
"scripts" array
✅ This is the recommended approach because:
It is easy to manage.
It works well with Angular CLI.
It keeps project dependencies organized.
2️⃣ Using CDN (Content Delivery Network)
Instead of installing locally, we can directly add Bootstrap links in the index.html file.
Add Bootstrap CSS and JS links inside <head> or before closing <body>.
✅ This method:
Is quick and simple.
Does not require installation.
But is not preferred for production because it depends on an external network.
